#text2tif

text2tif is a fork of [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)'s [text2image](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/b1c138284/training/text2image.cpp) program.

text2tif takes a text file as an input and generates a TIFF image and a *.box  file which contains bounding box coordinates for each glyph in the image.
